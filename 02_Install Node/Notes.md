## How to Install Node.js

### If You're Using **Windows**:

1. First, open Google and type: **Node.js download**

2. Click on the first link (it should be from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org))

3. You‚Äôll see two big green buttons. Click the one that says **LTS** ‚Äî this one is the stable version and good for beginners.

4. A setup file will start downloading (don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs safe).

5. Once it finishes downloading, **open the file**.

6. Now just keep clicking **Next**, like you do while installing any software. Don‚Äôt change anything ‚Äî default is fine.

7. After it installs, open the **Command Prompt** (just search for "cmd" in Start menu).

8. Type this command and hit Enter:

   ```
   node -v
   ```

   If it shows something like `v18.17.1` (or whatever version is latest), then **congrats, Node.js is installed!** 

9. Now try this command:

   ```
   npm -v
   ```

   This will show the version of **npm** (Node Package Manager). If it shows a number, then you're all set!
