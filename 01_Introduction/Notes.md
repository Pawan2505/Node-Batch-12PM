### **History of Node.js**

* Node.js was **created in 2009** by a developer named **Ryan Dahl**.
* Before Node.js, JavaScript was only used **inside browsers** (for frontend).
* Ryan thought: *“Why not run JavaScript on the server too?”*
* So, he built Node.js using **Google’s V8 Engine** (it’s super fast).
* Node.js was first shown to the world at **JSConf (a tech event)** in Europe.
* In **2010**, they introduced **npm** (Node Package Manager) to install useful packages.
* Later, big companies like **LinkedIn, PayPal, Netflix** started using it.
* Today, Node.js is a **very popular choice** to build backend apps using JavaScript.
